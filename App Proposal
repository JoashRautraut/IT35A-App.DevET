Goals
The project aims to support sustainable agriculture by giving farmers and agricultural communities with real-time perceptions on crop management,
climate adaptation, and sustainable farming techniques. The application promotes food security, environmental conservation, 
and manage agricultural practices in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Roles
The project will be developed in a mobile/web application that offers data-driven farming suggestion based on scientific research,
climate patterns, and agricultural best practices. The information will be sourced from:

•	FAO Agricultural Guidelines
•	Scientific journals on sustainable farming
•	Government and environmental research organizations
This secure farmers and agricultural workers have access to accurate, science-backed knowledge, reducing reliance on unsustainable or ineffective practices.

Audience
This application is designed for:

•	Farmers – Smallholder and large-scale farmers seeking better farmin techniques.
•	Agricultural Researchers – Scientists studying crop resilience and climate adaptation.
•	Environmental Advocates – Individuals promoting sustainable land use.
•	Policymakers & NGOs – Organizations working on food security and rural progeress programs.

Situation

Many farmers lack access to accurate, localized agricultural data, leading to unsupportable farming methods, low crop yields,
and environmental degradation. Also, climate change has intensified challenge in agriculture, requiring adaptive strategies.
This application provides farmers with real-time, research-based solutions to improve productivity while ensuring long-term environmental 
sustainability.

Objectives
The application is designed to:
•	Educates farmers on sustainable and climate-resilient farminng techniques.
•	Provide AI--powered crop management insights to maximize yield while minimizing environmental impact.
•	Reduce dependency on harmful agricultural practices through scientific knowledge.
•	Enhance food security beside promoting sustainable agricultural strategies.

Key SDG Targets
This project aligns with multiple SDGs, primarily:
SDG 2 - Zero Hunger -- Promoting food security through sustainable farming.
SDG 13 - Climate Action -- Encouraging climate-adaptive agricultural techniques.
SDG 15 - Life on Land -- Supporting responsible land use and biodiversity conservation

Key Features
• Crop Health Monitoring – AI-based system to detect plant diseases and suggest treatment options.
•	Climate Adaptation Tips – Real-time weather alerts and adaptive farming suggestion.
•	Sustainable Farming Guides – Step-by-step best method for eco-friendly farming.
•	Soil & Water Management Tools – Recommendation for soil fertility improvement and water conservations.
•	Community Forum – A space for farmers to exchange knowledge and experiences.
•	Offline Access – Key resources available without an internet connection.

Technical Architecture
The application is developed using modern technology stacks to ensure efficiency, scalability, and accessibility.
