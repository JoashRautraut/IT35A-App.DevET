G- Goal
The goal of this literature review is to evaluate and compare XML integration and web services, focusing on how well they facilitate data exchange and system interoperability, 
recommended techniques for optimizing their use in software development, and on how they are applied in industries like finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.

R- Roles 
As a researcher, my role includes:
1.	Literature Analyst – Gather, review, and analyze existing studies, journal articles, and technical documentation related to XML integration and web services.
2.	Evaluator – Compare the strengths, weaknesses, and best practices of both technologies to determine their effectiveness in different scenarios.
3.	Synthesizer – Combine findings from various sources to provide a well-structured discussion on XML integration and web services.
4.	Critical Thinker – Assess the real-world applications, challenges, and future trends in using these technologies for system integration.
5.	Communicator – Present your insights clearly through a research paper, report, or presentation aimed at an audience of software developers, system integrators, and instructors.

A- Audience
The audiences are comprised of knowledgeable professionals and instructors who are looking for a technical yet accessible analysis that could inform their understanding or decision-making
about XML Integration and Web Services. These individuals are experienced and familiar with technical topics and my task is to present clear insights backed by data and literature to educate
or inform them on these technologies' impact, their best practices, and use cases.


S- Situation
Students are tasked with independently researching XML Integration and Web Services to compare their effectiveness, best practices, and use cases. 
They must analyze credible sources and synthesize the information into a well-supported evaluation, focusing on how each technology fits into system integration.

P- Product/Performance/Output
Comparative Analysis Report: XML Integration vs. Web Services

Introduction

XML Integration and Web Services are key technologies used for system communication. XML is used for data representation, while Web Services enable application interaction. 
This report compares their functionalities, strengths, and weaknesses.

XML Integration

Purpose: XML is used for structuring and exchanging data between systems. It is platform-independent and allows users to define custom data structures.

Strengths:
Platform-neutral
Human-readable
Extensible and widely supported

Weaknesses:
Verbose syntax leads to large file sizes
Parsing can be computationally expensive
Lacks inherent data semantics

Web Services

Purpose: Web Services enable system interaction over a network, often using XML or JSON for communication. They support service-oriented architectures (SOA) and are typically
based on SOAP or REST protocols.

Strengths:
High interoperability
Supports service exposure and invocation
Scalability through statelessness (REST)

Weaknesses:
Performance overhead, especially with SOAP
Complex implementation (particularly SOAP-based)
Latency issues with remote calls
